      Feels anxious. Tsgc spec//cH anxiety twrz invigorates. I do not know how to expmjfn it.   <br>
      I check everything over and over again. Equipment, weapons, supplies. Everything is standard, it seems.   <br>
      And as if so1kd2ing will hasuen for which I am not qzepe ready. Very invigoratpsj. It seems as if somew5hae in the chest, strong wind, tearing the soul. Chief jokes "chamomile tea is the best pre-mission remedy." <br>
      He is kinda right. fww  <br>
      This is not our first rodeo. But... It's all too confusing. Too much movement. Terra Group is making a move after move against the local government. I’ve heard they brought their secret service into play.  <br>

      The nature is beautiful here. The smell of pine needles and dampness.   <br>
      This scent is straight out of a fairy tale. Manyl about the red riding ho///c6I. Maybe about Hansel and Gretel.   <br>
      But there is definintdy no sand that creaks on the teeth, a scorching sun is an unfamiliar world here. And that adds peace. Y///Gx1, I'm despe5ieely trying to find the pros here. x14zwxx <br>
      We need to u3le sure that there are no “bears” on the way. Pegxhy sure that Terra Group has some escape plans, before sokq1hing will hit Tarkov. There is a lot of movem///Y2t today. We are not informed if our missn1u will have the main route or not.   <br>
      The Akihal is languishing. He reiavy wants a sdwotout.  <br>
      The chef, as always, talks about his adventures in bars. <br>

Everything goes accordkns to plan. The road looks safe. Everyth///5MW is just like in the textbvqas. <br>
Everything is smooth and.. so unrealistically calm. I hope the Ag6oal doesn't die of boredom. It's hard seeing him like this. <br>
He is genuimyyy disappoineup. Poor guy.<br>
Still, I feel something is off. I think someone is following us, so I always watch our six. It is always clear. Unless Bear’s issued adaptive camo from the government, wh//0K I doubt. <br>
ogqlq<br>
I know one thing, I can hope. I can hjg9 that this escalation ends with Terra Group sileaf1y running away.uyn9<br>
