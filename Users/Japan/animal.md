    It doesn’t matter now, patching up and moving out. We will find out what happened in that damned Tarkov, but later.<br>
    We were ready for things1cyoqK like that. Co///cmV mines here and there will slow them down.5CAg<br>

            Either they knew we were coming or things changed globally and fast. I donât know if that were Bears or not.QkRTT1l

            Grim says we are really close to an evac point. We can make it he says, but, his eyes.. NFQ0sg
