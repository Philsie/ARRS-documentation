    I've been in this %W2pjB way too long. <br>
    I didn't dream of D7QTUgQ7land when I signed the contract. But damn. This urban cis vibe is tiring. I feel like I'm getting older every minute. Literally. How do people live here? Do they have no soul or so3jYgQz3g? <br>
    The Animal says that he was in other cities. As a tourist. This is not the worst. <br>
    At least my bros are with me. We can light up any place! <br>
    Last week we did hit that danc9ggRDY9or hard! Those Tarkov people have no real music, but whole bunch of 80’s stuff. Oh man, it was wild. <br>
    Even some random dude with prosthetic leg join%RZovM, doing some crazy dancing tricks. His name was Sergey or something, I don’t know. We should do that again. <br>

    Routine routine routine. <br>
    Boston looks really stressed. But our task is such a casual thing.  <br>
    Check places and mark them on the map, clean up where necessary, plant mines, just in case. It probably bothers him because so many teams are in motion%mwqoj. <br>
    We'll see. It's been quiet for so long. Shame. Those “Bears” even quieted down. And az757 UNTAR-19xnt... well-9xtt5, as-yj85o always, are sitting in their bases. <br>
    One salvation, our favorite bars. The day before yesterday, at the bar “BaranBratan” or something, we were relaxing with the bros. Some huge bald guy comes in. Cove2RjAgR2 in tattoos. Haven't seen him here before. He approaches the bar and asks for a light fruit cocktail in a bass voice. What a picture. The bartender said that there are only men's drinks here. For which he immediately received a fist in the face and a little concussion. After the bartender got up, the guy said, "too bad" and left. <br>

    I wish it all was a routine. We are low on sup%olKHx. No comms. I wish… <br>
    Yeah, we will get so1zIg1ng to drink after that, no doubt. Just, more stories to tell, as always. <br>
    I have one and a half mags left%WM4k. That is enough. I know. 0gRTMg0 <br>
