    Sadly, you couldn't get here first!

    Your colleagues were able to reach the target before you did.
    From their regional ARRS Terminal branch, I've gained access to the Laboratory's security systems.
    Now anyone still left in the city can go after TerraGroup's secrets.

    I know you're wondering what would have happened
    if you'd gotten here before your colleagues.
    Your branch holds data that would've given access
    to a secret TerraGroup warehouse in one of Tarkov's locations.
    It appears to contain some kind of potent hallucinogen.
