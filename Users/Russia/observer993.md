  I see that you managed to get to this point first!

  That's a great result, which brings us to the next stage.
  From this regional branch of the ARRS Terminal, I've gained access to the Laboratory's security systems.
  Now anyone still left in the city can go after TerraGroup's secrets.

  I know you're wondering what would have happened if your colleagues had gotten there first,
  but you can figure it out yourself.

This is the end of the branch of users starting with [baker](./baker.md) found IRL on a poster in St. Petersburg.

Discovering this accound has lead to BSG tweeting the `Win` note: https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1683528751341027329. <br>
At the same time an ingame event started - The Lab is free to enter for both PMCs and Scavs.
