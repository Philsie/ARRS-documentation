      Won my first Battleship game. It was awesome. Only lost two ships. THIS IS THE BEST SHIP FORMATION, NO ONE COULD BEAT ME ALL NIGHT!  <br>
        <br>
      I'll save it just in case  <br>
        <br>
      And how simple it turned out to be, it was as if the solution had always been on my forehead. I just had to birth the idea from it.  <br>

              Lately I've been smelling a constant gasoline odor. There's no way to escape the feeling. It's like I've had a disease and now I'm facing the consequences. But all right. At least my favorite candy still tastes the same. <br>
