	cH That was intense. I have finally got that adrenaline I have wanted. I dumped couple mags towards those bastards, probably scared them off. cy<br>
	Oi I saw a hit, not sure if that was armor, but I saw his eyes, full of panic, questioning if this is it, haha. The other one got dust in his face, should’ve used those tactical glasses. Bs<br>
	bH Sadly, we had to retreat. We are not equipped for full scale assault operations. We are lacking lmgs, gls, arty support, all the good stuff. B5<br>
	bW Oh I wish we had more toys, oh I wish. hi<br>

	ZW Chief tries to be positive. As positive as possible.<br>
	It's harder without a foot, but he's trying. Seems like it is all he has left with.<br>
	We were very unlucky to run into several ambushes. On the other hand, they didn't expect us so soon.<br>
	This gave us the opportunity to hit and run. It was fun, but rather ugly. Need to go back.<br>
	All we have is each other now. To be honest, Chief is not looking good at all, he has lost too much blood already.<br>
	Preston did everything he could for him. Mg<br>
