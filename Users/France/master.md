* Fail_1_3 <br>
  Sadly, you couldn't get here first!

  Your colleagues were able to reach the target before you did. 
  From their regional ARRS Terminal branch, I've gained access to the Laboratory's security systems.
  Now anyone still left in the city can go after TerraGroup's secrets. 
  
  I know you're wondering what would have happened 
  if you'd gotten here before your colleagues. 
  Your branch holds data that would've helped 
  with the provocation in the City and let us lure the so-called "Bosses" there.
