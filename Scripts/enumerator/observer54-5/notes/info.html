  # # # # # #<br />Situation has changed. Several countries have received data from regional ARRS Terminal accounts. I decided to add a little variety to your "research work" in the form of a small competition. And now, you and a few of my other volunteers are entering the race, so to speak.Â <br />Whoever can get to the end first wins. Depending on which region the winner is from, we'll continue our investigation in that area, plus one more shady bit of business.<br /><br />Mr. Kerman<br /># # # # # #
